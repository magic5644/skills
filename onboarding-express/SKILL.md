# Onboarding Express

AI-guided architectural tour of any codebase for a new developer.
Powered by Graph-It-Live — extracts entry points, business logic, and the most complex module in one structured pass.

## Requires

Graph-It-Live CLI installed and indexed:

```bash
npm install -g @magic5644/graph-it-live
graph-it scan
```



## When to Use

- A developer joins the team and needs a codebase overview
- You want to understand an unfamiliar project quickly
- You need to identify where business logic lives before a refactor
- You want to find the most complex/risky module before making changes

---

## Workflow — Step by Step

### Step 1 — Build the index

```bash
graph-it scan
```

Always run first. All subsequent commands depend on it.

---

### Step 2 — Workspace overview

```bash
graph-it summary --format toon
```

Parse the output to identify:
- Top-level files and their role
- Candidate **entry point files** (look for: `index`, `main`, `app`, `server`, `cli`, `bootstrap`, `startup` in filenames or in exported symbols)
- Candidate **business logic folders** (look for: `services`, `domain`, `core`, `usecases`, `business`, `handlers`, `controllers`)

---

### Step 3 — Identify the 3 main entry points

For each candidate entry file (max 5), run both directions:

```bash
# Outgoing: what this file calls and imports
graph-it explain <filePath> --format toon

# Incoming: who imports/calls this file
graph-it tool find_referencing_files --filePath=<absolutePath>
```

Rank by:
1. **Highest fan-out** (outgoing) + **0 fan-in** (nothing imports it) → true root entry points
2. **High fan-out** + **few importers** → secondary entry points (e.g., CLI, alternative bootstraps)
3. **High fan-in** (imported by many) + **exports many symbols** → shared core, not an entry point
4. Presence of bootstrap / initialization patterns in the call tree

Select the **top 3** and for each, produce:

> **Entry point `<filename>`** — `<one-line role description>`
> Called by: `<callers or "root — no callers (true entry point)">` 
> Calls into: `<top 3–5 downstream modules>`

---

### Step 4 — Locate the business logic

For each candidate business logic file, run **both directions** to build a complete dependency picture:

```bash
# Outgoing: what this file exports, imports, and calls internally
graph-it tool generate_codemap --filePath=<absolutePath> --format toon

# Incoming: who depends on this file across the project
graph-it tool find_referencing_files --filePath=<absolutePath>
```

The combination of both tells you:
- **generate_codemap** → what the file does (exported symbols, internal call depth, its own dependencies)
- **find_referencing_files** → how central it is (how many other files rely on it)

Look for files that score high on both axes: many exports **and** many importers. A file with rich exports but no importers is dead code; a file with many importers but few exports is a utility hub. The real business logic sits at the intersection.

Pick the **1–3 files** with the highest combination of fan-in + exported symbol count. These are the business logic core.

---

### Step 5 — Find the most complex module

For each file in the index (or a sampled top-20 by size), run:

```bash
graph-it tool analyze_file_logic --filePath=<absolutePath>
```

Score each file using this heuristic:

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Internal call depth (max recursion level) | High |
| Number of internal cycles (circular calls) | High |
| Number of exported symbols | Medium |
| Number of distinct callers (fan-in) | Medium |
| Number of distinct callees (fan-out) | Medium |

The file with the highest combined score is the **most complex module**.

---

### Step 6 — Trace the critical path

From the highest-scored entry point, trace the full execution chain:

```bash
graph-it trace <entryFile>#<mainFunction> --format mermaid
```

Use `--format mermaid` here because the output is intended for a human — the Mermaid diagram renders as a visual flowchart in VS Code, GitHub, Obsidian, and most Markdown preview panes. For all other graph-it calls in this workflow, prefer `--format toon` (token-efficient, AI-readable).

### Project Tour — `<ProjectName>`

**3 Main Entry Points**

| # | File | Role | Type |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | `src/index.ts` | Application bootstrap, wires all modules | True entry (no callers) |
| 2 | `src/api/router.ts` | HTTP routing, dispatches to controllers | Called by index.ts |
| 3 | `src/cli.ts` | CLI interface, alternative entry point | True entry (no callers) |

**Business Logic Core**

| File | Exported Symbols | Referenced By |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| `src/services/orderService.ts` | 12 | 8 files |
| `src/domain/pricing.ts` | 7 | 5 files |

**Most Complex Module**

> `src/services/orderService.ts` — 4 levels of internal call depth, 2 internal cycles, imported by 8 files.
> **Recommendation**: Any change here has high blast radius. Run `get_impact_analysis` before modifying.

**Critical Path (Mermaid)**

## Tips

- On a **monorepo**, scope the tour per package: `graph-it scan --root packages/api` then repeat the workflow.
- If `graph-it summary` returns too much data, filter by folder: `graph-it summary src/core --format toon`.
- The "most complex module" heuristic is architectural, not cyclomatic. For line-level complexity, combine with a linter.
- After the tour, run the **Dead Code Hunter** skill to find safe cleanup targets before the new developer starts writing code — a clean codebase is much easier to onboard into.
- For deeper call-graph questions ("what calls this function?", "what breaks if I change X?"), use the **Graph-It-Live** skill directly.
