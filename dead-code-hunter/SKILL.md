# Dead Code Hunter

Systematic scan of the dependency graph to surface orphan symbols and unreferenced files.
Produces a ranked, safety-annotated deletion plan powered by Graph-It-Live.

## Requires

Graph-It-Live CLI installed and indexed:

```bash
npm install -g @magic5644/graph-it-live
graph-it scan
```

## When to Use

- Before a major refactor — clean up before you restructure
- After removing a feature — confirm nothing is left dangling
- Periodic code hygiene pass on a growing codebase
- Before onboarding a new developer — reduce noise in the codebase

---

## Workflow — Step by Step

### Step 1 — Build/refresh the index

```bash
graph-it scan
```

The reverse lookup index (who imports what, who calls what) is always built automatically — no extra flags needed.

### Step 2 — Run workspace-wide dead code scan

```bash
graph-it check                     # scan entire workspace
graph-it check src/                # scope to a specific folder
graph-it check src/ --format toon  # toon format saves 30-60% tokens
```

Or via the MCP tool directly (supports `scopePath` param):

```bash
graph-it tool scan_dead_code
graph-it tool scan_dead_code --scopePath=/abs/path/src
```

This returns a ranked list of dead symbols and ghost files in a single pass. **No per-file loop needed.**

---

### Step 3 — Per-file confirmation (avoid false positives)

`scan_dead_code` uses static analysis. A symbol may be called **dynamically** or **from outside the indexed workspace** (e.g. a published library). For high-confidence verification on specific candidates:

```bash
# Who calls this symbol? (0 callers = confirmed dead)
graph-it tool get_symbol_callers --filePath=<absolutePath> --symbolName=<symbol>

# Is this file imported by anything? (0 refs + not an entry point = ghost file)
graph-it tool find_referencing_files --filePath=<absolutePath>
```

- **0 callers** → confirmed dead code candidate
- **1+ callers** → false positive, discard
- **Only test-file callers** → flag as "test-only symbol", handle separately

A ghost file may contain multiple symbols — mark the entire file for deletion rather than symbol-by-symbol.

---

### Step 4 — Rank candidates by deletion safety

Apply this risk classification:

| Risk Level | Criteria | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Safe** | 0 callers, 0 referencing files, not a public API export | Delete freely |
| **Likely safe** | 0 callers confirmed, file has other live symbols | Remove symbol, keep file |
| **Review first** | Symbol is exported from a barrel (`index.ts`) | Check if barrel is consumed externally |
| **Do not delete** | Dynamic call patterns detected (`eval`, string-based dispatch) | Flag only |
| **Test-only** | Only called from test files | Evaluate — may be intentional |

---

## Output Format

Produce a **Deletion Plan** in this format:

---

### Dead Code Scan Report

**Scanned**: `<N>` files | **Candidates found**: `<M>` symbols + `<K>` ghost files

#### Ghost Files (entire file can be deleted)

| File | Last modified | Reason |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `src/utils/oldMigration.ts` | 2022-03-11 | 0 imports, 0 callers, not an entry point |

**Suggested command:**
```bash
# Review first, then:
rm src/utils/oldMigration.ts
```

#### Orphan Symbols — Safe to Remove

| Symbol | File | Kind | Callers |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| `formatLegacyCurrency` | `src/utils/format.ts` | function | 0 |
| `MD5Hash` | `src/services/auth.ts` | function | 0 |

#### Orphan Symbols — Review First

| Symbol | File | Risk | Note |
|--------|------|------|------|
| `createReport` | `src/api/index.ts` | Barrel export | Check if consumed by external packages |

#### Test-Only Symbols

| Symbol | File | Test callers |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `mockPaymentGateway` | `src/mocks/payment.ts` | 3 test files |

---

### Recommended Deletion Order

1. Ghost files first — highest impact, no surgical precision needed
2. Orphan symbols in non-barrel files — safe, isolated changes
3. Barrel exports — requires checking external consumers
4. Test-only symbols — discuss with the team

## Safety Checklist Before Deleting

- [ ] Re-run `graph-it scan` + `graph-it check` after any refactor that modified imports
- [ ] Check if the project is a **published library** — unused exports may be part of the public API
- [ ] Check `package.json` `exports` field — symbols exported via package entry points are always live
- [ ] Run the test suite after each deletion batch to catch dynamic usage not visible to static analysis
- [ ] Commit in small batches — one file or one symbol group per commit for easy revert

---

## Quick Scan (Single File or Folder)

```bash
graph-it scan                                                                     # build/refresh index
graph-it check src/utils/format.ts                                               # per-file unused symbols
graph-it check src/utils/                                                        # scoped folder scan
graph-it tool find_unused_symbols --filePath=/abs/path/src/utils/format.ts       # same as above, MCP tool
```

---

## Limitations & Future Improvements

- **Dynamic dispatch** (`obj[methodName]()`, `require(variable)`) is invisible to static analysis — always review before deleting
- **Monorepos**: scan per package, not at root, to avoid cross-package false positives
- **Framework magic**: decorators (`@Component`, `@Injectable`) may make symbols appear unused but they're resolved at runtime — exclude framework entry files from the scan
- **`graph-it check` is the native single-pass dead code scanner** — `graph-it check` (no args) runs `scan_dead_code` across the whole workspace. Use `graph-it check <folder>` to scope by directory.
